# Firm Website

Generate content from here to be hosted at [libfirm.org](http://libfirm.org).

Requirements: asciidoc, [ycomp](http://libfirm.org/yComp)

If your libfirm is not at `../libfirm` relative to this directory,
create a `config.mak` file according to `config.mak.example`.

Executing `make` from the root builds everything into the `build/website` directory.

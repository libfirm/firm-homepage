Testing
=======

Testsuite
---------

We have a repository with lots of small test programs along with a testing driver script in:

[source,bash]
$ git clone http://pp.ipd.kit.edu/git/firm-testsuite.git

Buildbot
--------

We also started using buildbot for automatically running tests on pushs.
You can find it here:

* http://buildbot.info.uni-karlsruhe.de/[]

If you have access to the firm account then you can edit the config like this:

[source,bash]
$ ssh firm@i44sun3
$ cd buildbot_config
(edit master.cfg)
$ git commit -m "did some changes on the master config" master.cfg
$ ./install_master_config.sh

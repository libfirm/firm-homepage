New Developers
==============

This site collects good advice to novice firm developers. So if you're new to firm and want to contribute please read the following points carefully.

Coding Conventions
------------------

Please respect the link:Coding_Conventions[Coding Conventions]

Committing
----------

If you're a student your probably have full access to the repository. Nonetheless consider the following points:

* Don't even think about commiting if your code doesn't compile
* Grab the testsuite and see if your changes broke any testcases (note that there are usually some testcases broken anyway, but your code mustn't increase the number of broken testcases)
* And if this is your first commit (to the firm repository): *Show us your code and let us do a code review before you commit!*

Debugging
---------

Make your life a little easier and use the link:Debug_Extension[Debug Extension]. Make sure you grab the .gdbinit file from that site.

Object Orientation
==================

Basics
------

Many modern languages use object-oriented constructs. These includes:

* compound-datastructures with associated methods (class types)
* inheritance hierarchies for class types
* dynamic-dispatch when calling methods in an class hierarchy
* multiple-inheritance, in the form of interfaces or "true" C++-style multiple inheritance

The following 2 are also very common in OO-languages though are orthogonal concepts.

* runtime-type information (introspection of object types, which enable dyanmic casting or reflection)
* throwing exceptions (these in itself are not an OO-concept) and catching exceptions based on their runtime type
* Garbage Collection

This article attempts to describe how to model some of these aspects in firm

Implement them as a library
---------------------------

libFirm at its core is concerned with low-level code. object-orientation is consider as a high-level feature which will be lowered to low-level code. Bases on this definition these features should not be part of libfirms core.
Instead we attempt to provide them as an add-on library called liboo.

Note though that we should keep libfirms core open for extensions of this kind this means:

* Creating new nodes
* Registering optimization rules for these new nodes
* Support creationg of new types/entities? (not possible currently)

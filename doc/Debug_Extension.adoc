|=======================

Usage
-----

libFirm contains a builtin debug extension helping set breakpoints and inspecting data.

Environment Variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When firm starts up the environment variable FIRMDBG is interpreted as debug commands.
Examples:

.Break when node number 123 is created
[source,bash]
$ FIRMDBG="create 123" my_firm_compiler

.Enable full debug logging for the firm.be.prefalloc module
[source,bash]
$ FIRMDBG="setmask firm.be.prefalloc -1" my_firm_compiler

Inside a debugger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The debug extension is accessed using the builtin `firm_debug` function.

In gdb, issue a call

 call firm_debug(".help")

In the Visual Studio Debugger, simply place a call into the watch window.

Debug Functions
---------------

Further, the following functions/expression might be useful while debugging

[options="header,footer",cols="1,2"]
[frame="topbot",grid="none"]
|=======================
|Function|
|`current_ir_graph` | the current graph, set by most libFirm functions
|`dump_ir_block_graph(irg, suffix)` | dumps graph irg
|`dump_ir_block_graph_sched(irg, suffix)` | dumps graph irg
|=======================

Usage in gdb macros
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can predefine gdb macros for common constructs like displaying an `ir_node*` or dumping the current graph for opening it in ycomp.
The following is a good idea:

[source,bash]

include::gdbinit[]

<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Committing"> Committing </span></h1>
<p>If you're a student your probably have full access to the repository. Nonetheless consider the following points:
</p>
<ol><li> Don't even think about commiting if your code doesn't compile
</li><li> Grab the testsuite and see if your changes broke any testcases (note that there are usually some testcases broken anyway, but your code mustn't increase the number of broken testcases)
</li><li> And if this is your first commit (to the firm repository): <b>Show us your code and let us do a code review before you commit!</b>
</li></ol>
<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Debugging"> Debugging </span></h1>
<p>Make your life a little easier and use the <a href="Debug_Extension.html" title="Debug Extension">Debug Extension</a>. Make sure you grab the .gdbinit file from that site.

<p>This site collects good advice to novice firm developers. So if you're new to firm and want to contribute please read the following points carefully.

<h1><span class="editsection">[<a href="/firmw/index.php?title=CLIParser&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Committing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Committing"> Committing </span></h1>
<p>If you're a student your probably have full access to the repository. Nonetheless consider the following points:
</p>
<ol><li> Don't even think about commiting if your code doesn't compile
</li><li> Grab the testsuite and see if your changes broke any testcases (note that there are usually some testcases broken anyway, but your code mustn't increase the number of broken testcases)
</li><li> And if this is your first commit (to the firm repository): <b>Show us your code and let us do a code review before you commit!</b>
</li></ol>
<h1><span class="editsection">[<a href="/firmw/index.php?title=CLIParser&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Debugging">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Debugging"> Debugging </span></h1>
<p>Make your life a little easier and use the <a href="/firm/Debug_Extension" title="Debug Extension">Debug Extension</a>. Make sure you grab the .gdbinit file from that site.
